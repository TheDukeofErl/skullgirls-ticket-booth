Platforms
	support
		Linux (I use it)
		Windows (majority of people use it)
			hopefully Qt looks nice on there
	unsupported
		OS X
			I don't have a good way to test
			setting up OS X VMs is a painful process
			I doubt very many people playing skullgirls use OS X
			maybe someone will want to make that supported at some point and fork/PR that? :D

Parsing the .ini files: the formatting on these is a little weird, they delimit on space and repeat keys
	trying to use configparser
		lack of a [section] causes issues, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2885190/using-configparser-to-read-a-file-without-section-name
		still can't parse correctly due to repeated keys: configparser.DuplicateOptionError: While reading from '<???>' [line 10]: option 'fighter' in section 'top' already exists
	it'll be simpler to just make something instead of relying on config parser

it's probably going to be worth setting up my own .conf file for this:
	format
		can use configparser for this (even though it didn't work before)
		json might be nicer, though the file probably won't be comlex enough to justify it's use
	avoid having to scan for a dir each time by saving off the path
	set previous screen location
	set previous window size
	best location for this?
		platform specific?
			Linux: ~/.config (XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
			Windows: appdata
		platform agnostic (ish)?
			Linux: ~/.local/share/Skullgirls ($XDG_DATA_HOME/Skullgirls)
			Windows: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Skullgirls\
		I'm leaning towards the second one but am not sure
		could also just have it write the file in the same directory it's run in: do I want this to be installed?
			I'll probably add it to the AUR so I guess so... is that worth it though?
			could support portable and installed configurations (probably more than I want to do)
			I don't really want to have to make an updater so portable might be easier anyways
				check for updates is probably necessary though :/

SG Directory locations:
	Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/Skullgirls
	Windows: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Skullgirls
	Inside of these
		save games
			Linux: /SaveData
			Windows: \Save Data
		replays
			Linux: /Replays
			Windows: \Replays_SG2EPlus
	PCGamingWiki notes that it's not sure if non-standard XDG_DATA_HOMEs are honored: may be worth just treating that directly as ~/.local/share.
